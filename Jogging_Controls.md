#Jogging Controls

Jogging is when you move the robot yourself by clicking one of the arrow buttons in the interface. These are the jog controls:

These are what each button does:

Try clicking around to move the robot. 

###Crash! 

You are going to crash the robot -- dont worry, it is a matter of *when* not *if* you crash, and your OT.One can handle it. You just need to know what to do when it happens. 

##### Homeing: The robot has a home switch on each of its axes, the XYZ of the gantry and the AB for the pipettes. Every position you will set for the OT.One to run a protocol later is defined relative to this 'home' or 'zero' position. 

When you crash the robot, the robot is no longer in sync with its 'home' -- its zero point is going to be thrown off due to the crash. So, you need to re-home the robot. These are the homing controls:
