### Connect Everything

First thing to do is plug everything in correctly. 

1. Plug the ethernet cable from your computer into the RPi.
2. The RPi to the Smoothieboard with the short USB-A to USB-B.
3. Smoothieboard to 12V powersupply in wall socket. This is the round barrel jack and larger power brick.  
4. Hit the on button to send power to the motors.

Finnally, connect the RPi to 5V power supply in wall socket. This is the micro-USB like an Android phone charger, and goes in the top of the RPi in the slit in the aluminum box. 

_When you plug in the RPi, the robot will begin to boot up,_ and the motors will home at the end of boot (approx 3 minutes). Be ready for the motors to move before plugging in the RPi!
