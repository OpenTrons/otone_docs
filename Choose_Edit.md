#Choose and Edit a Protocol

The OT.One runs protocols based on OT-Protocol JSON documents like this one: [protocol.json] (docs/protocol.json)

This is an OT-Protocol JSON document explained: [OT-Protocol JSON Explained] (docs/ot-protocol_spec.md)

(Dont worry if that sounds foreign to you -- [JSON] (http://json.org/) is just a way of structuring textual data hierarchically, and OT-Protocol is just JSON used in a way specific to liquid handling robots)
