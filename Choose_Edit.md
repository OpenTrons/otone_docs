#Choose and Edit a Protocol

The OT.One runs protocols based on OT-Protocol JSON documents like this one: [protocol.json] (docs/protocol.json)

This is an OT-Protocol JSON document explained: [OT-Protocol JSON Explained] (docs/ot-protocol_spec.md)

([JSON] (http://json.org/) is just a way of structuring textual data hierarchically, and OT-Protocol is just JSON used in a way specific to liquid handling robots)

##### 1- Download OT-Protocol Document from Mix.Bio

Each protocol document specifies the which pipette(s) are on the robot head, what labware is on the robot deck, and then what instructions that the robot follows for a given run. Find the OT-Protocol document that seems to be closes to what you are looking for in the [Mix.Bio Protocol Library] (https//:mix.bio/browse) and download it.

###### 2- Edit OT-Protocol 

You can edit the document you downloaded from the Protocol Library with the [Protocol Editor] (https//:editor.mix.bio). Just browse for your downloaded OT-Protocol document, or drag the JSON file directly in as shown here:
